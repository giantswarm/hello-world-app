# hello-world-app

A very barebones app for testing features of the Giant Swarm App Platform.

It contains just enough to deploy your first hello world website on your cluster.

## Configuration

Please refer to the [chart's README.md](https://github.com/giantswarm/hello-world-app/blob/main/helm/hello-world-app/README.md).
